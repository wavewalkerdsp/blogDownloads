# A half-band filter is efficient due the number of zero weights which do 
# not require computation when filtering. The function abstracts the Remez
# filter design function call for half band filter weights specifically.
# 
# The function requires both NumPy and SciPy. They can be installed by:
#
#	$ sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy
#
#
# 
# The function can be called by:
#
# 	from halfBandDesign import halfBandDesign
# 	weights = halfBandDesign(filterLength,transitionBand)
#
# The filterLength parameter determines the length of the filter. filterLength
# must be an integer where filterLength+1 is divisible by 4 and greater than 6.
# For example, filterLength=7, 11, 15, 19, etc.
#
# The transitionBand parameter is the transition bandwidth of the filter
# and must be greater than 0 and less than 0.5.

import scipy.signal
